make a app (could be pure python with ui too) that conduct machine learning algorithm to play chess (that covers evey possible move and position or scenarios on playing chess), it should be able to play chess at a grandmaster level or beyond. It has an option to play chess locally and for the other feature i want to select a part of my screen (for example im going in online tornament and i will select a part of the screen that only has the chess board then it predict the best move for me or forcast the best move on that scenario)
